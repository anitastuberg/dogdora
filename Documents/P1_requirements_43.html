			<!--Client-->
			<div class='box'>
				<h2>Administrative details</h2>
				<h4>Our client: DogDora</h4>
				<h4>Our contact person: Fido Langbein</h4>
				<p>
					Fido Langbein is the owner of DogDora, and will be our
					contact person through the entire process of making the
					website.
				</p>

			<!--Purpose and goals-->
			<div class='box'>
				<h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
				<p>
					The site’s main goal is to give dogs in Trøndelag a safe home.
					Every aspect of the website will be designed to fulfill this goal.
					It is also important to spread awareness about dogs in need of a
					home and give information about how to relocate a dog in need to a
					shelter. It will also be easy to find information about the shelter
					and how to get in touch with the shelter.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another goal is to give people the opportunity to contribute to the
					animal shelter and make it easy to sign up for volunteering.
					Providing information about how to donate in just a few clicks will
					hopefully increase the amount of donations to the shelter. It will
					be possible to send an application to the shelter if you are
					willing to volunteer. This solution will save time for both the
					user and the shelter as well as spread awareness about volunteering
					for the shelter.
				</p>

				<p>
					To lighten the workload of the shelter, a goal is to make it easier
					for the shelter to obtain information about the people wanting to
					adopt. This will make it easier for the shelter to make sure that
					the dogs will get a safe home. To accomplish this goal, the user
					must fill in a form with personal details and send it to the
					shelter before visiting.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!--Audience-->
			<div class='box'>
				<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p>
					The audience for DogDora is people that want to adopt a
					dog, give one away or want to contribute by doing voluntary
					work or through donations.  DogDora has just one location
					which is in Trondheim. Therefore the audience will be the
					locals in Trøndelag. With just one location DogDora
					specializes for their local customers and volunteers. They
					have specialized on more sport oriented adopters, and not
					the classical “town dogs” like chihuahua because that is
					what the local people in Trondheim want.
				</p>

				<p>
					On the site, there are three unique visitors: the adopter, the dog
					owners that want to put their dog up for adoption, and the people
					who want to help by donating and volunteering. Each of the unique
					visitors have their own goal for visiting the site.
				</p>

				<p>
					The adopter wants to see the dogs they can adopt, read about the
					process, and get to know the dog they want to adopt.  The people
					who want to put their dog up for adoption want to see information
					about the process, and what's required.  The people who want to
					help out need information on how they can do it, and information.
					The website needs to accommodate all the unique visitors and give
					them the information they want without them needing to look for it.
					we can accomplish this by having clear sections for each group of
					users.
